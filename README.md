None of this was coded by me, I'm just reposting since I was able to set it up by myself  
  
I've tried running it on another computer and it should be good to run as-is with no setup required     
Thanks to Sakura616 for the RES, and few other chinese people sorry I forgot your names :( 
  
1. Make sure to have MongoDB Installed  
2. Install FiddlerClassic as well  
3. Run them and press on Start.cmd, if there are any issues you can open an Issue I guess, i'll try my best to help
