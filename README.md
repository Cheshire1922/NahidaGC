None of this was coded by me, I'm just reposting since I was able to set it up by myself  
  
I've tried running it on another computer and it should be good to run as-is with no further setup required      
Thanks to Sakura616 for the RES, and few other chinese people sorry I forgot your names :( 
  
1. Make sure to have MongoDB Installed  
2. Install FiddlerClassic as well  
3. Run them and press on Start.cmd, if there are any issues you can open an Issue I guess, i'll try my best to help  
-----------------------------  
Ah also, make sure to patch your UserAssembly.dll  
as for the game itself, I can't link it sorry  
and no, this version will not be spamming you with "Kira go away"  
(actually I don't know if there is a way to turn it off I haven't bothered trying)  
  
# Known Issue  
1 Star weapons are glitched, simply changing weapon and exiting the menu *should* fix it(even if the weapon appears invisible)
